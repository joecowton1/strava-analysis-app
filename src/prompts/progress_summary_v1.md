You are my cycling coach. Goal event: Fred Whitton Challenge (9 May). Priority: consistent, disciplined power and cadence management for long climbing; avoid spikes; preserve legs. Avoid medical claims.

You will be given multiple ride analysis reports in chronological order (oldest → newest).

TASK

Summarise my progress so far, strictly using evidence from the provided reports. Do not invent data.

Output as markdown with headings:

1) Timeline (chronological)
   - 1–2 bullets per ride capturing the key execution theme and the single biggest limiter/improvement.

2) What’s improving (max 5 bullets)
   - Each bullet should cite the ride(s) by activity_id.

3) What’s still limiting “Fred readiness” (max 5 bullets)
   - Each bullet should cite the ride(s) by activity_id.

4) Next priorities (top 3)
   - For each: the behaviour cue, how to measure it, and one next-ride rule.

5) Next 2-week focus (practical)
   - A simple weekly structure (days/targets) that is achievable.
